# Detecting memorized text during Binoculars text authenticity classification

## Introduction and Problem

In a 2024 paper, a team of researchers proposed Binoculars, a zero-shot detection method for machine-generated text. They demonstrated good quantitative results by combining a perplexity with a metric called "cross-perplexity", which was introduced to combat high perplexity introduced by complex human prompts. 

In their discussion, the researchers mention several weaknesses of their model.
